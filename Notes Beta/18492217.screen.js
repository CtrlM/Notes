When did the action take place?<br\/><br\/>\nExample: I drove a car. (past tense)<br\/>\n\tI drive a car. (Present tense)<br\/>\n\tI will drive a car.(Future tense)<br\/><br\/>\nLet us take it further. A tense can be simple, continuous or perfect.<br\/><br\/>\nSimple tense is an action that takes place at the moment.<br\/><br\/>\nContinuous tense is an action that takes place at the moment and will stop at any point in time. For example: I am typing these notes.<br\/>\nContinuous tense is characterised by the verb that has an '-ing' ending.<br\/><br\/>\nPerfect tense refers to an action that has been completed in relation to a point in time. \"In relation to a point in time?\"<br\/>\nWhat does that mean. <br\/><br\/>\nPresent tense and future tense can have a perfect form. But you may ask yourself if perfect tense refers to a completed action, <br\/>\nhow can it also be present(takes place) and future(will take place).<br\/><br\/>\nThink of it this way. If I do something earlier on the present day the action is still completed right? Yes, it is.<br\/>\nExample. I have eaten breakfast earlier today.<br\/><br\/>\nNB: Always be consistent when using tenses. <br\/><br\/>\nThe following sentence would be incorrect: The student is busy [studied] for her exam.(inconsistent tense).<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>","updated":1542980081,"css":"","secured":false,"javascripts":[],"events":[]}}});
